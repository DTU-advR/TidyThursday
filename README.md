CBio Thursday - Introducing Tidyverse in R
================

Before the Workshop
-------------------

Due to time constraints, it is *super important* that you make sure to go through the following *before* the workshop:

### Internet Connectivity

Please note, the following internet connectivity options sorted according to descending speed/stability:

-   DTU net if you are a student at DTU
-   [Eduroam](https://www.eduroam.org/) if you are a student at another University
-   DTU guest accounts (Arranged by CBIOvikings)
-   Your phone as an access point

### Workshop with no internet access

It is possible to attend the workshop with no internet connection, however then you *must* have succesfully installed [the latest version of R](https://mirrors.dotsrc.org/cran/) and also the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Note you must install `R` first and then `RStudio`.

### Workshop with internet access

If you have internet access, then go to [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) and create an account and start a new project.

### Installing Tidyverse

Once you have either `R/RStudio` running on your laptop or created an RStudio Cloud account, you can install [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) like so:

``` r
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Congratulations! That's it! Now you're ready for the workshop - See you soon!
